<h2>Adaptive and Robust ZUPT Detection Studies</h2>

<p align="justify">Adaptive ZUPT studies [1-4]. Robust ZUPT detection studies employ various non-inertial sensing technologies such as magnetic sensors [5], dynamic vision sensors (i.e., event cameras) [6], range sensor (i.e., ulrasonic sensor) [7] to accurately detect ZUPT samples in gait cycle and improve INS results.</p>

<h2>Foot-Mounted Pedestrian Inertial Navigation Datasets</h2>
<p align="justify">There are various datasets that are annotated with Vicon equipments. Some datasets are public [8-9]. Some datasets are not public [10-12]. OptiTrack (an optical motion capture system) study uses Heuristic Drift Reduction (HRD) to deal with heading errors [12].</p>

<h3>About PyShoe Dataset</h3>
<h4>Johan Wahlström & Isaac Skog's comments</h4>
<p align="justify"><b>Wahlström</b> <i>et al.</i> states that a reasonable approach to detect the actual ZUPT samples in a gait cycle would be to label the sensor unit as stationary whenever the velocity is zero [13]. This approach suffers from sensor and modeling errors as mentioned in [13]. More importantly, as the gait speed of the pedestrian changes, the threshold has to be calibrated. The natural solution is to set this threshold in such a way that the navigation performance is optimized. This idea is explored in PyShoe, where several zero-velocity detectors with different fixed thresholds were applied, one by one, to a number of motion trials (sequences of training data). This included both conventional detectors (e.g., SHOE, ARED) based on foot-mounted inertial measurements and detectors that utilized velocity estimates from high-accuracy reference systems (i.e., VICON). For each motion trial, ground-truth zero-velocity labels are extracted from the detector-threshold pair that gave the best positioning performance. To ensure that the best-performing fixed-threshold detector is approximately optimal over a given motion trial (so that there is no time-varying threshold that will give a substantially better performance), the environment and gait style (e.g., walking, running) were fixed within each individual motion trial.</p>

<p align="justify">PyShoe dataset is divided into two groups: Training and testing data. The training data - consisting of walking, running, stair-climbing, and crawling - was recorded from one user in a motion capture area of about 5m x 5m, and includes ground truth position from a camera tracking system. The testing data is divided into two subsets. The first subset was recorded in the hallways of a university buiding and includes ground truth at manually surveyed locations. This subset was recorded from five users alternating between walking and running. The second subset was recorded from one user walking up and down a staircase and includes ground truth vertical position data on a per-flight basis. In addition, each data recording in the second subset started and ended at the same position, and thus, the position accuracy can be evaluated based on
the corresponding loop-closure error. In [98], this data set was used to compare the performance of six zero-velocity detectors. Code was provided alongside the data.</p>

<h3>Studies that use PyShoe</h3>
<p align="justify">In [1] it says: "Publicly Mixed-Motion Dataset (referring to PyShoe): This dataset consists of the VICON dataset, the Hallway dataset, and the stairs-climbing dataset. The VICON dataset is collected by a LORD Micro-Strain 3DM-GX3-25 IMU at 200 Hz. As pointed out in PyShoe, it consists of 60 experiments, which not only includes walking and running modes but also stair-climbing and crawling modes. Both the Hallway dataset and the stairs-climbing dataset are collected by a Vector Nav VN−100 IMU at 200 Hz. The Hallway dataset consists of 38 motion experiments, which includes walking, running, and combined motion modes. The ground truth of the Hallway dataset is obtained by measuring the locations of the flat markers on the floor. A handheld trigger is given to record the current location versus the known marker location. In the stairs-climbing dataset, only the heights of trajectories are recorded."</p>
<p align="justify">In [1], PyShoe dataset is used to detect the ZVPs for the proposed IGLRT detector, in which not only the ground-truth position information is provided but also the ground-truth binary zero-velocity labels (moving versus stationary) are also provided. Since the trajectories of trials in the VICON dataset are very short, the Hallway dataset is also used to evaluate the performance of the proposed IGLRT detector.</p>
